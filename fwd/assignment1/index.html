    <h1>Places I want to visit</h1>
    <h2>Germany</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a young child I would read and watch all sorts of media regarding history, as a young boy I was always captivated by war and its part in history. Germany, being a large contributor in the two World Wars was prominently mentioned in the media I was consuming. As I grew older I gained a desire to visit places of historical value, Germany being one of such places. I would love to visit all the areas in which battles took place, take in the senerey that has both changed and not changed over the many years since.</p>

    <h2>Japan</h2>
    <p>As an avid history nerd, Japan is a place with a rich history that would be wonderful to view in person. This place has countless beautiful seneries and the culture is so different from what we know here. They even have a cat island, who doesn't want to see a cat island! I have eated at numerous Japanese themed resturants and I have to say, the food is amazing. It would be a true delight to experience the thing in person.</p>

    <h2>International Space Station</h2>
    <p>To start off, if anyone says they wouldn't want to visit the International Space Station (ISS) they are a liar. Everyone wants to visit this place, even if the thought of going into space scares them, that is a fact that I made up myself. When I was a kid I always wanted to be an astronaught, but then I grew up and realised that becoming one of those is a lot of work. So I decided to learn programming instead. Still cool in my eyes, but not astronaught cool... Space is the final frontier for us as humans, and I'll be damned if I don't get to visit it in our technologically advanced future!</p>
